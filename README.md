## Problem Statement
Develop and deploy a RESTful API service using Spring Boot to streamline the room booking process for a hotel management aggregator application. The service must use MySQL for data persistence. 

The application is simplified, focusing on essential features of a hotel booking system.

- **HotelNotFoundException**: Thrown when a hotel with a given ID is not found. This exception returns a `404 Not Found` HTTP status code.
- **BookingNotFoundException**: Thrown when a booking with the specified ID does not exist. This exception returns a `404 Not Found` HTTP status code.

## Security

The service uses **JWT tokens** for stateless authentication. Each protected API endpoint requires the inclusion of a valid JWT token in the request header for authorization.

Roles:
- **CUSTOMER**: Can browse hotels, book a room, and view their bookings.
- **HOTEL MANAGER**: Can update hotel details and cancel bookings.
- **ADMIN**: Has full control, including creating and deleting hotels.

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are included for:
- **Authentication**: Ensures users can successfully register and log in.
- **Hotel Management**: Verifies that only admins can create and delete hotels, and hotel managers can update hotel details.
- **Booking Management**: Ensures customers can book rooms and hotel managers can cancel bookings.
